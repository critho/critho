  Hi there! I’m Critho

<h2 align="center">A game designer and developer based in Germany</h2>



I love to offer people a great experience in the form of video games.

Outside of game design, you’ll find me gaming, hitting the gym, or editing videos. I also enjoy posting on [**social media**](https://www.critho.social), sharing my interests.
