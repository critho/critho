  ### Hi there!

I’m [**Critho**](https://www.critho.social), a game designer and developer based in Germany.

I love to offer people a great experience in the form of video games.

Outside of game design, you’ll find me gaming, hitting the gym, or editing videos. I also enjoy posting on social media, sharing my interests.

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea.
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
